### Git going
###### Getting started with git (best practices)

This template should help you contribute to OMG Wiki. There's a shorter empty template here [http://github.omgcoporative.com]. It's fairly self explanatory, just download the primer and replace this text with a brief explanation on your tutorial. Followed by a list of key areas the article is focused on. It's always good to have a list of contents early on in the post to make sure that your readers have a good bearing. Contents can be either an ordered or unordered list.

Main content, relief and conclusions follow right after the contents list. After which you can post references. That said, your post is yours to write; add humor and ease into it. Make it as simple as you can. There's really no need to use big words unless your reader is already comfortable with your posts. Ratings for posts get people interested in what you have to say. We let our readers and students rate our content and suggest improvements. Remember, readers love it when you relate your own experiences.

####### Note on structure
  
  - Introduction

  A short introduction goes here. The first few lines are important in getting the readers attention. Keep it simple and explain what the post is about. A single line or two should do for an introduction. For example, "This post is about posting your essays, tutorials and lessons on the Open Media Group Wiki. It's a guide for you to get git hooked up to your wiki branch effectively. Of course submitting to the wiki is easiest still on your browser."

  - Who this is meant for

  The Open Media Group wiki is a curriculum based on subjects by career programmers and newbies for programmers. Posts are categorized by level desired. Its assumed that entry level programming tutorials and Computer Science posts will be most popular. But you can pretty much write about anything programming, tech, popular science or computer science related. There is a seperate post about writing specific curriculum posts here [http://github.omgcoporative.com] To access current posts you can either sign up for a github account and join the Society, or contribute as a guest. 
  
  This template is meant for contributions in general (Wiki, tutorials, curriculum, general tips...etc). We will cover git basics, how to contribute and how to post from your machine locally. Its assumed that you are somewhat familiar with git basics. You can also simplify this post by writing seperate guidelines and then linking back here. You can always talk to us about simplifying a specific post and find more about contributions by requesting an invite on Slack here [http://omgco.slack.com]


  - What you will learn
  If you are new to git, please head over to github.com and make an account. Its assumed that you have a working knowledge of Git. This post will cover the bare specifics of pointing a wiki branch on your local machine and then pushing new posts onto the OMG wiki.

  - Hang ups
  Your post may be merged with other edits, and any changes you make can also be merged to a previous commit. If you feel that your post loses its initial goals as decribed in the introduction, please make a pull request and reference back to the issue. Issues can be posted by anyone.
